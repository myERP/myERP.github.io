h1(#general). REST API : General

h2. Resources

There's two kind of resources in myERP. Actual Datas from your domain, and those who refers to a kind of data as a whole.

h3. Actual Data

They end with the *id* of the actual data they refer to.

p. Sample

{% highlight bash %}
curl -X GET {{ site.api.base_url }}{{ site.api.v1}}{{ site.resource.account.url}}55002 {{site.api.auth_pattern}}
{% endhighlight %}
*55002* is the *id* of the account you are trying to get. Within myERP, you can find this id at the end of this account URI edition mode:
{% highlight bash %}
https://app.myerp.com/index.jsp?locale=en_US#account/55002
{% endhighlight %}

Those are often used for GET (to retrieve a data), PUT (to edit a data) or DELETE (to delete a data) request.

h3. Data type

There's no id into them, and they got a *s* at the end.

p. Sample

{% highlight bash %}
curl -X GET {{ site.api.base_url }}{{ site.api.v1}}{{ site.resource.accounts.url}} {{site.api.auth_pattern}}
{% endhighlight %}
This will retrieve the whole list of your accounts.

Those are used to create new data of this kind, using POST request.
They are also usefull when you want to create or delete several datas of a specific kind in a row.


h2. JSON Fields

h3. Missing fields

* Creation: if the missing field is mandatory, an error message will be returned. Otherwise, the default value will be applied.
* Edition: the missing field is ignored, and no changes will be performed on it.

h3. Non existant fields

If your JSON contains any fields that are not managed by the resource, those fields will be ignored.

h3. Duplicates fields

If a field is duplicate within the JSON or a resource, the value of last one will prevail.

h3. Wrong values

* Bad type: If any value of a wrong type stands into your JSON, the parsing of the JSON will turn wrong and an error message will be returned.
* Wrong value: Some fields only accept certain values. If the value of such a field is wrong in your JSON, an error message will be returned.
* Non editable: While editing a resource, if any field that is not editable stands within your JSON, and tries to perform an actual modification, an error message will be returned.

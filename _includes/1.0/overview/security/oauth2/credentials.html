    <h2>Client Credentials</h2>

    <p>To obtain a client credentials, please ask our support team.</p>

    <p>When requesting the credentials, you must provide us the following information:</p>

        <li>URL of the website of your application</li>
        <li>A callback URL <code>redirect_uri</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The callback URL is the endpoint to which the OneUp Authorization Server will send the authorization code, after the user authenticates and allow your application to consume his data.</p>

    <p>The following information will be provided to you after your client credential is created:</p>

    <table class="table table-bordered table-striped">

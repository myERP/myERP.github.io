    <h2>OAuth2</h2>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>OneUp API supports <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749" target="_blank">OAuth 2.0 protocol</a> for authentication and authorization.</p>

    <p>To use OAuth authorization, you first have to obtain the client credentials. Then your client application requests an authorization code from the OneUp Authorization Server, exchange it for an access token and finally sends that access token to the OneUp API.</p>

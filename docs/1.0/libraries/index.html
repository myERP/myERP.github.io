<h1>API Clients</h1>
<p>myERP makes it easy to use the myERP API in your programming language of choice. We provide you with official myERP libraries and third party libraries for authenticating and interacting with the myERP API. Check out these resources.
</p>


<h2 class="blue">Ruby: myERP API gem</h2>

<p>The myERP API gem allows Ruby developers to programmatically access the data of myERP accounts. The API is implemented as JSON over HTTP using all four verbs (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE). Each resource, like Account, Item, or Order, has its own URL and is manipulated in isolation. In other words, weâ€™ve tried to make the API follow the REST principles as much as possible.</p>

    <h2>Client Credentials</h2>

    <p>To obtain a client credential, ask our support team.</p>

    <p>When requesting the credential, you must provide us with a callback URL <code>redirect_uri</code>.</p>

    <p>The callback URL is the endpoint to which the OneUp Authorization Server will send the authorization code, after the user authenticates and allow your application to consume his data.</p>

    <p>The following information will be provided to you after your client credential is created:</p>

    <table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th class="parameter">Parameter</th>
                <th class="description">Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>client_id</td>
                <td>The unique id of your client</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>client_secret</td>
                <td>The secret key which your application will use to exchange authorization codes for access tokens</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
